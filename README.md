# AddressBook

I kept the functionality & Bootstrap design simple and minimalistic.
Would like to add more features if time allows.

I really enjoyed learning the Laravel Framework.

As of now, I am still puzzled as to why the delete function in ContactController
isn't actually deleting from the DB. Might be a SQLite issue. I will remove this
comment as soon as I resolve this.
